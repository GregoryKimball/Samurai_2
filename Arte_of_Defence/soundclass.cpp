//To start first open the .wav file and read in the header of the file. The header will contain all the information about the audio file so we can use that to create a secondary buffer to accommodate the audio data. The audio file header also tells us where the data begins and how big it is. You will notice I check for all the needed tags to ensure the audio file is not corrupt and is the proper wave file format containing RIFF, WAVE, fmt, data, and WAVE_FORMAT_PCM tags. I also do a couple other checks to ensure it is a 44.1KHz stereo 16bit audio file.

//Now that the wave header file has been verified we can setup the secondary buffer we will load the audio data onto. We have to first set the wave format and buffer description of the secondary buffer similar to how we did for the primary buffer. There are some changes though since this is secondary and not primary in terms of the dwFlags and dwBufferBytes.

	// Set the wave format of secondary buffer that this wave file will be loaded onto.
	waveFormat.wFormatTag = WAVE_FORMAT_PCM;
	waveFormat.nSamplesPerSec = 44100;

	bufferDesc.guid3DAlgorithm = GUID_NULL;

//Now the way to create a secondary buffer is fairly strange. First step is that you create a temporary IDirectSoundBuffer with the sound buffer description you setup for the secondary buffer. If this succeeds then you can use that temporary buffer to create a IDirectSoundBuffer8 secondary buffer by calling QueryInterface with the IID_IDirectSoundBuffer8 parameter. If this succeeds then you can release the temporary buffer and the secondary buffer is ready for use.

	// Create a temporary sound buffer with the specific buffer settings.
	result = m_DirectSound->CreateSoundBuffer(&bufferDesc, &tempBuffer, NULL);
	if(FAILED(result))
	{

	}
 
	// Test the buffer format against the direct sound 8 interface and create the secondary buffer.
	result = tempBuffer->QueryInterface(IID_IDirectSoundBuffer8, (void**)&*secondaryBuffer);
	if(FAILED(result))
	{
		return false;
	}
 
	// Release the temporary buffer.
	tempBuffer->Release();
	tempBuffer = 0;

//Now that the secondary buffer is ready we can load in the wave data from the audio file. First I load it into a memory buffer so I can check and modify the data if I need to. Once the data is in memory you then lock the secondary buffer, copy the data to it using a memcpy, and then unlock it. This secondary buffer is now ready for use. Note that locking the secondary buffer can actually take in two pointers and two positions to write to. This is because it is a circular buffer and if you start by writing to the middle of it you will need the size of the buffer from that point so that you don't write outside the bounds of it. This is useful for streaming audio and such. In this tutorial we create a buffer that is the same size as the audio file and write from the beginning to make things simple.

	// Move to the beginning of the wave data which starts at the end of the data chunk header.
	fseek(filePtr, sizeof(WaveHeaderType), SEEK_SET);
 
	// Create a temporary buffer to hold the wave file data.
	waveData = new unsigned char[waveFileHeader.dataSize];

	{
		return false;
	}
 
	// Read in the wave file data into the newly created buffer.
	count = fread(waveData, 1, waveFileHeader.dataSize, filePtr);
	if(count != waveFileHeader.dataSize)
	{
		return false;
	}
 
	// Close the file once done reading.
	error = fclose(filePtr);
	if(error != 0)
	{
		return false;
	}
 
	// Lock the secondary buffer to write wave data into it.
	result = (*secondaryBuffer)->Lock(0, waveFileHeader.dataSize, (void**)&bufferPtr, (DWORD*)&bufferSize, NULL, 0, 0);
	if(FAILED(result))
	{
		return false;
	}
 
	// Copy the wave data into the buffer.
	memcpy(bufferPtr, waveData, waveFileHeader.dataSize);
 
	// Unlock the secondary buffer after the data has been written to it.
	result = (*secondaryBuffer)->Unlock((void*)bufferPtr, bufferSize, NULL, 0);
	if(FAILED(result))
	{
		return false;
	}
	
	// Release the wave data since it was copied into the secondary buffer.
	delete [] waveData;
	waveData = 0;
 
	return true;
}

//ShutdownWaveFile just does a release of the secondary buffer.

void SoundClass::ShutdownWaveFile(IDirectSoundBuffer8** secondaryBuffer)

	return;
}

// PlayWaveFile function will play the audio file stored in the secondary buffer. The moment you use the Play function it will automatically mix the audio into the primary buffer and start it playing if it wasn't already. Also note that we set the position to start playing at the beginning of the secondary sound buffer otherwise it will continue from where it last stopped playing. And since we set the capabilities of the buffer to allow us to control the sound we set the volume to maximum here.
