Hello,

This is a 3D sword-fighting game that I am working on.

Press "g" to spawn team 1 characters.
Press "h" to spawn team 2 characters.
Use "[" and "]" to switch the active character controlled by the user.

Move with QWEASD, swing the sword with the mouse.

The project also contains Arduino code for an accelerometer accessory that can also be used to control the sword.

Bye!

Greg
